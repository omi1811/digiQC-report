Quality Expert Assistant - Deprecated
Previously used Gemini API, now replaced with self-contained CivilQualityExpert in civil_quality/llm.py

This file is kept for backward compatibility but is not used.
The Quality Expert functionality is now handled by:
- civil_quality/llm.py (CivilQualityExpert - knowledge-based responses)
- civil_quality/engine.py (process_query endpoint)
- civil_quality/session.py (slot analysis)
- civil_quality/schemas.py (data structures)
"""

# This module is deprecated. Use civil_quality.engine.process_query instead.
